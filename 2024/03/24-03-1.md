### Effects
#### render/run a part of the code only once
### 👼

ReactJS refreshes the thing(component, UI) that changed

 `state change` => `re-render` => `all the code will run again`


### 🤔🤔🤔
#### all the code will run again
1. want to run the code only one time at the start
2. want to run the code on a specific time
3. want to run the code on a specific data in a component changes

#### useEffect
Choose when should the code run

```javascript
useEffect( , )        //1st: function, 2nd: dependencies(what react should watch to update)

const [keyword, setKeyword] = useState("");
const [count, setValue] = useState(0);

//1. watch nothing
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("this code will run only once at the first time");
}, []);

//2. watch one item
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("this code will run when 'keyword' changes");
}, [keyword]);

//3. watch two items
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("this code will run when 'keyword' & 'count' any of them changes");
}, [keyword, count]);
```

#### Cleanup
allows to do something when the component is being destroyed

define a cleanup funtion inside a effect function
